# GamesmanUni

ABOUT
=====

GamesmanUni is a web implementation of GamesmanClassic, a Tcl/Tk program developed as part of GamesCrafters research and development group at UC Berkeley. Gamesman is a finite, two-person, perfect-information game solution generator based on Professor Dan Garcia's master thesis.

GamesmanUni is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) as well as Single Page Application (SPA). It is backwards compatible with older browser environments. It is designed to run on any platforms as long as there is an internet access and a browser with JavaScript enabled. In devices with modern browsers, it is also possible to download the application as either a desktop or mobile application.

If you are a developer and want to see how this was made, please consult the Mozilla developer documentation for more detailed information and try out the JavaScript console in the browser (F12).

PLAYING
=======

Head on over to https://nyc.cs.berkeley.edu/uni/ to look at the available games! The page should be pretty self explanatory, but to get started, simply click **Games** then pick a game you would like to try. From there, you can click a game variant (if you can't decide, just try out regular :]). 

From there, you can click positions on the game board image (on the left side) to play! There are also the **Restart**, **Undo**, and **Redo** buttons for your playing pleasure.

Additionally, under the themes menu there is a gear icon for **Settings.** This has additional options such as hiding the clock and visual value history. To the right of the gear icon is an i icon for **Instructions.** These are under development, so Googling how to play might be more helpful now.
